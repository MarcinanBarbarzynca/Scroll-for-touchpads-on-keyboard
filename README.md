# Scroll-for-touchpads-on-keyboard
This script was created using Autoit. 

# What is used for?
I've got dell laptop thats too old to get normal touchpad drivers. It discovers it as multitouch and dont let me install side scrolls. 
I had to make simple script to emulate mouse wheel by hotkeys. 

# Keyboard mouse wheel :)
